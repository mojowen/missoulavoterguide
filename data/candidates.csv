Listen to all ideas from all people",Yes,,Yes,,Yes,I generally support this plan but it would be contingent on funding being available and a 3 year or less Return on investment,Unsure,I would continue to support funding during the Trial period. After that time if no private funding or grants are available I would support a citywide public vote on funding options subsidy for the bus line. Long Term I believe the bus company must operate with minimal public tax dollar subsidy.,No,"I was against the method the city used to acquire the water company. Better outcomes happen with a willing buyer and willing seller negotiating a sale of the water company. If condemnation prevails I would support it, conditional on the cost of financing by Public Bonds if that equaled lower water rates. I also would advocate oversight by the court to protect users by granting the Public Utilities commission authority for future rate increases.",No,

- Ensure the budget reflects the community’s priorities and values
- Enhance the well-being of Missoula’s residents, economy, and environment",Yes,"The City can incentivize the type and location of housing necessary through land use and transportation policy, development of infrastructure, and perhaps tax policy. Enhanced efforts to develop existing and attract new businesses that diversify the economy and pay higher wages would likely make a difference, as would continued improvements in processes administered by Development Services. Additionally, City government should continue support of the Missoula Housing Authority, and access to and availability of Section 8 benefits as well as HUD and VA programs. City government can also support the valuable and necessary efforts of organizations like Homeword and the North Missoula Community Development Corporation as well as look at policies that could help defray the cost of land.",No,,Yes,"I think the City has established a good goal. I admire the City of Missoula and the community members who were involved in developing the CCAP. It is fitting for our local government to lead by example in terms of taking actions in areas in which the administration has direct control, such as hiring a staff person to implement the CCAP and monitor effectiveness, improving fleet and facilities management, choosing to build “green”, and reducing energy use.",Yes,,Yes,"Yes, I support it. As many folks know, the eminent domain case for Mountain Water came after several efforts to resolve this issue through its purchase on the open market and negotiations with the Carlyle Group in terms of the right of first refusal in the event of a sale. I don’t think anyone in city government took lightly the step of initiating an eminent domain case. Furthermore, I support public ownership of the city’s water system. There are a host of good reasons for this including the ability of the City to conduct maintenance to limit negative effects of leaks on roads and other infrastructure; head off the possibility of partitioning and selling off water rights or parts of the system; direct construction of infrastructure and thus development; ensure citizens receive the highest quality water and customer service; use income to support the system; and implement incentives to protect the quality and the quantity of this important community resource.",No,
