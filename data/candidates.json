Enhanced efforts to develop existing and attract new businesses that diversify the economy and pay higher wages would likely make a difference, as would continued improvements in processes administered by Development Services. Additionally, City government should continue support of the Missoula Housing Authority, and access to and availability of Section 8 benefits as well as HUD and VA programs. City government can also support the valuable and necessary efforts of organizations like Homeword and the North Missoula Community Development Corporation as well as look at policies that could help defray the cost of land.","support an ordinance prohibiting sitting or lying down on public sidewalks downtown?":"No","support an ordinance prohibiting sitting or lying down on public sidewalks downtown?--moreinfo":"","support the city becoming carbon neutral by 2025?":"Yes","support the city becoming carbon neutral by 2025?--moreinfo":"I think the City has established a good goal.

I don’t think anyone in city government took lightly the step of initiating an eminent domain case. Furthermore, I support public ownership of the city’s water system. There are a host of good reasons for this including the ability of the City to conduct maintenance to limit negative effects of leaks on roads and other infrastructure; head off the possibility of partitioning and selling off water rights or parts of the system; direct construction of infrastructure and thus development; ensure citizens receive the highest quality water and customer service; use income to support the system; and implement incentives to protect the quality and the quantity of this important community resource.","support purchasing military equipment for the city's police force?":"No","support purchasing military equipment for the city's police force?--moreinfo":"","name":"John DiBari","photo":"./images/counselors/DiBari.John.png"},{"ward":"4","first name":"Patrick","last name":"Weasel Head","website":"","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/patrick.weaselhead?fref=ts","phone number":"406-550-1869","email address":"pweaselhead@bresnan.net","fact":"Still crazy after all these years, and giving back to the community in which I love.","why":["Maintain a vibrant downtown promoting minimum wages","Being a voice for disenfranchised individuals and groups","Keeping home owner taxes in check"],"priortize affordable rental housing development?":"Yes","priortize affordable rental housing development?--moreinfo":"","support an ordinance prohibiting sitting or lying down on public sidewalks downtown?":"Unsure","support an ordinance prohibiting sitting or lying down on public sidewalks downtown?--moreinfo":"","support the city becoming carbon neutral by 2025?":"Yes","support the city becoming carbon neutral by 2025?--moreinfo":"","continue funding to mountain line to ensure that the bus remains free?":"Yes","continue funding to mountain line to ensure that the bus remains free?--moreinfo":"","support the city's acquisition of the water system through condemnation?":"Yes","support the city's acquisition of the water system through condemnation?--moreinfo":"","support purchasing military equipment for the city's police force?":"Unsure","support purchasing military equipment for the city's police force?--moreinfo":"","name":"Patrick Weasel Head","photo":"./images/counselors/Weasel Head.Patrick.jpg"},{"ward":"5","first name":"Julie","last name":"Armstrong","website":"http://www.missoulaward5.com/","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ward5pride","phone number":"406-493-2343; 406-493-0853","email address":"missoulaward5@gmail.com","fact":"I never use my real name, I was a Div I swimmer; I have an eventing horse & 2 English bulldogs, & I can’t cook anything with sugar in it.","why":["Bringing in higher paying jobs","affordable single-family housing","managed growth"],"priortize affordable rental housing development?":"Yes","priortize affordable rental housing development?--moreinfo":"","support an ordinance prohibiting sitting or lying down on public sidewalks downtown?":"No","support an ordinance prohibiting sitting or lying down on public sidewalks downtown?--moreinfo":"","support the city becoming carbon neutral by 2025?":"Yes","support the city becoming carbon neutral by 2025?--moreinfo":"","continue funding to mountain line to ensure that the bus remains free?":"Yes","continue funding to mountain line to ensure that the bus remains free?--moreinfo":"","support the city's acquisition of the water system through condemnation?":"Unsure","support the city's acquisition of the water system through condemnation?--moreinfo":"","support purchasing military equipment for the city's police force?":"No","support purchasing military equipment for the city's police force?--moreinfo":"","name":"Julie Armstrong","photo":"./images/counselors/Armstrong.Julie.png"},{"ward":"5","first name":"Chase","last name":"Callen","website":"https://chasecallenformissoulacitycouncil.wordpress.com/","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ChaseCallen4CityCouncil","phone number":"406-214-2306; 406-721-1381","email address":"chasecallen@gmail.com","fact":"I was born unable to walk due to severe club feet.
